CoDoc is a desktop app for students in SoC (School of Computing) to connect with each other for the benefit of their course of study. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoDoc can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps and networking with people can be easily done.
