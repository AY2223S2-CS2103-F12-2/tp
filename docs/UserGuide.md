#### Welcome to CoDoc, a desktop app that allows students in SoC to connect with each other for the benefit of their course of study. CoDoc is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CoDoc can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps and networking with people can be easily done.

## Quick Start

### Download and Installation

Before you can use CoDoc, you need to download it. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer. -> [How To Check Java Version](#how-to-check-java-version)
   * If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)
2. Download the latest version of `codoc.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3.trial).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for CoDoc.<br>
   For example,
   1. Create a new folder in your Desktopâ€”this folder will then be the _home folder_.
   2. Place `codoc.jar` into the newly created folder.
4. Open a command terminal -> [How to Open CoDoc](#how-to-open-codoc)
   1. `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in.
   2. `java -jar codoc.jar` to run the application.<br>
   3. A window similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

### Navigation

Before we begin, let's familiarize ourselves with the different parts of the CoDoc interface.
Maximise the screen to have a clearer view.
This way you can see more content as well.

<img src="images/navigation.png"/>

- **Menu Bar:** if you ever feel stuck, you can always click on the `Help` button here or enter `help` in the command box. 
- **Command Box:** this is where you can type in commands.
- **Result Display:** shows the result of a command that you have executed.
- **Person List Panel:** here are your contacts in CoDoc.
- **Course List Panel:** you can refer to this list when adding a person.
- **Info Panel:** displays information about a selected person, such as their contact details, modules, and skills, which are presented as tabs.

### Tutorial

Now that you know how to navigate CoDoc, let's start by adding a person to our contact list! To do this, follow these steps:

#### 1. Adding a person

Let's start by adding a person named Bob, a year 2 student taking Computer Science with the email e0823741@nus.edu. 

Enter the command `add n/Bob y/2 c/6 e/e0823741@nus.edu` into the command box. This will add a new person named Bob to our contact list. 

**Note:** You must specify minimally, the person's _name_, _email_, _year_ and _course_ when adding a person.

As you can see, we first specify the `add` command followed by the _name prefix_ `n/` and the _name_ that we want to add i.e. `Bob`. Same goes for the _year_, _course_ and _email_. 

**Note:** The person's _course_ corresponds to its index in the course list panel.

Here we used `c/6`, because if you look at the course list panel on the left, Computer Science refers to index `6`. 

If you want to, you can add other details of the person such as his/her _GitHub username_, _LinkedIn profile URL_, _modules_ and _skills_.

Related docs: [Adding a person: `add`](#adding-a-person--add)

If you followed the steps above correctly, you would see this screen:

<img src="images/tutorial/adding-bob.png"/>

**Note:** Your profile pictures and the profile pictures shown here will not be exactly the same as they are randomised.

#### 2. Viewing a person's modules

As shown above, the right info panel automatically updated to show Bob's contact after we added him. 

Now let's take a look at his _modules_: enter `view m` in the command box. As you can see, his module list is currently empty.

<img src="images/tutorial/viewing-bobs-modules.png"/>

You can enter `view s` as well if you want to see Bob's _skills_. You can also view another person by specifying the person's index in the list i.e. `view 2` would load Nicole Lee in the info panel.

**Related docs:** [Viewing a person/Changing tabs: `view`](#viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view)

#### 3. Editing a person's modules

To update Bob's module list to have let's say CS2101 and CS2103T, first make sure that Bob is shown in the right info panel, by entering `view 8`. 

Then enter `edit m/ay2223s2 cs2101 m/ay2223s2 cs2103t` in the command box. 

**Note:** Editing only works on the person shown in the info panel. If the person you want to edit is not shown in the info panel, you have to use the `view` command first to view that person, then edit as you wish. Also, _modules_ must follow a certain format to be successfully added/edited.

**Related docs:** [Viewing a person/Changing tabs: `view`](#viewing-a-personchanging-tabs--view), [Editing a person: `edit`](#editing-a-person--edit)

Bob's updated module list (use `view m` to see) would look like this after you entered the `edit` command:

<img src="images/tutorial/editing-bobs-modules.png"/>

You might be thinking why not we just add Bob's _modules_ in the first place when adding him? You can do that! But for this tutorial, we have separated it to show how you can use the `edit` command. 

You can also edit other details of the person such as his/her _name_, _year_, _GitHub username_, etc., not just their _modules_.

**Related docs:** [Adding a person: `add`](#adding-a-person--add), [Editing a person: `edit`](#editing-a-person--edit)

#### 4. Finding a person by their modules

Let's try to find contacts that are taking/have taken CS2103T. First, let's reset all existing filters if they have been applied. We can do this by entering `list`. This shows us all the contacts in CoDoc. 

Then enter `find m/cs2103t`. This would show the contacts in the person list panel that have CS2103T in their module list:

<img src="images/tutorial/finding-cs2103t.png"/>

Here, if you followed the previous steps correctly, Bob would be shown as well.

Our `find` command is pretty powerful; it works for other attributes, like _year_, _skills_, etc. and you can find by multiple attributes. To learn more about it, you can take a look at [Finding a person: `find`](#finding-a-person--find)

**Related docs:** [Finding a person: `find`](#finding-a-person--find), [Listing all persons/Resetting filters: `list`](#listing-all-personsresetting-filters--list)

Congrats! You have completed the tutorial ðŸŽ‰ 

The pre-existing contacts are just some examples that you can play around with, but if you want to start with a fresh contact list, enter `clear` to clear all contacts. Also, if you need more info on the usage of each command, you can refer to the relevant sections below.

## Data Management
**Q**: How do I save my person list?<br>
**A**: CoDoc automatically saves your person list after every successful `add`, `edit` and `clear`.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install CoDoc in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CoDoc home folder.

**Q**: Where is the data file stored?<br>
**A**: CoDoc data are saved as a JSON file at ***[JAR file location]*****/data/codoc.json**. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

:warning: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CoDoc will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
